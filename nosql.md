How to best build infrastructure to be efficient to build and operate? Once you recognize it, implies a bunch of things how software can operate on it knowing those boundaries.

Lots of software gets built ignoring undelying infrastructure constraints and not embracing them at all. Constraints should be considered when architecting.

Abstractions are not good or bad, but should embrace underlying reality, not deny it. 

We tend to judge quality of a product by who does use it: ex.: Google, Facebook, etc. We should not judge a product as a failure if dropped by the creators: running it three years in production is a great win. Changes may refer to different needs. Published papers are not roadmaps for development, and are years behind current state.
