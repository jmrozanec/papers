[The class imbalance problem: a systematic study](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~nat/Papers/techreport-imbalanced.ps.gz)

Results:
Conclusions: the class imbalance problem is a relative problem that depends on:
- the degree of imbalance
- the complexity of the problem represented by data
- the overall size of the training set
- the classifier involved

C5.0 is the most sensitive of three algorithms with categorical sesitivenes (sometimes very accurate, sometimes fails on 25% of test set); multi-layer-perceptron (has a more progressive sensitiveness); and support vector machines, not being sensitive at all.
